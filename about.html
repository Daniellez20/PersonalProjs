    <h2>What is architecture?</h2>
    <p>
      The profession of designing the buildings, open areas communities and other artificial constructions and environments, 
      usually with some regard to aesthetic effect. Architecture often design or selection of furnishings and decorations, 
      supervision of construction and remodeling of existing buildings.The art or practice of designing and constructing buildings. 
      Architecture also has the power to inspire and delight- it can enhance everyday experiences. It is built realistication of 
      a particular concept, or idea. This Idea can be a construction, or the way people will use a building, or how the building 
      fits into a physical, or a social, landscape.
    </p>

    <h3>The philosophy of Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The philosophy of architecture examines issues concerning the nature of architecture as an art form, design medium or other 
      production/manufacturing process. It looks into architectural products: what they are; how they are distinguished from 
      non-architectural objects; how we collectively refer to them. It also explores particular architectural properties, such 
      as space, form, light and how they might be considered especially architectural qualities. Finally, architectural philosophy
      concerns itself with the various types of architecture – how we consider instances and groupings of architecture occurring 
      on the landscape. As well as how we form our basic understanding of architecture and architectural objects, alongside the 
      social, cultural and moral implications of the practice of architecture and its objects.

    <h3>The history of Architecture </h3>
    <p>
      The history of Architecture has evolved over the centuries. It started during
      the Ancient Mesopotaminas, Egyptians, Greek and other civilizations in the 
      world. The origin of architecture to date to the Neolithic period or the New 
      Stone Age, when people stop living in caves and started building their houses.
      People use architecture to build their houses, bases and farms. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ancient Mesopotamians used sun-dried mud bricks houses and bases. They also used water irrigation to keep their farm 
      to keep the soil wet. Mesopotamians used canals and ditches to lead water from river in the fields.
      The water irrigation also helped to control the flooding. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, architecture evolved. During the Renaissance in Europe, architecture revival and developments emerged. 
      Rich people send their children to school during the Renaissance. Architect students studied different styles, emphasized 
      symmetry, proportion and geometry.

    <h3>The Importance of Architecture </h3>
    <p>
        Architecture is the art that provides us with the physical environment we live in. It is a deep expression of human 
        civilization in a particular era and it will endure and outlive us in forms of monuments that future generations will 
        study and strive to understand. All architects represent a great force in our society because architecture is as well 
        an expression of the strengths of the society as well as their technological progress.
    </p> 
    <p> Architecture is a form of visual art that creates irrevocable works. Humans value this art so much because it’s 
        a permanent expression of the society values, desires, ways of thinking and ideals, ideology and many other things 
        in a fixed point in time. It is like a reflection in the mirror, a way society sees itself as well as how it sees 
        the environment, nature and finally, this world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Architecture can indeed serve us as a little time capsule of human history. It reveals us human thoughts, ideals,
        ideas, even our fears and worries. All human emotions and thoughts can be reflected in one powerful piece of art 
        that lies ahead of us while we remain still, watching it in awe. It reflects our culture, who we are and where we belong within the society.

    <h3>Architectural Style and Characteristics </h3>
    <p>Throughout the history, different architectural styles emerged. Here 
      are some of the most influential architectural styles and their characteristics.
    </p>
    <h4>Victorian</h4>
    <p>
      Victorian architecture refers to an era - the reign of Queen Victoria over United 
      Kingdom of Great Britain from 1837 to 1901. Victorian architecture is a jumble of
      Gothic architecture, French, Italian and Egytian details. Some of the characteristics of Victorian 
      architecture are Victorian buildings have two to three stories, textured walls, 
      one-story porch, wood or stone exterior, vibrant color and complicated and 
      assymtrical shape. Several styles of Victorian-era architecture spread internaionally
      to places like Australia, North America, New Zealand and various countries.

    <h4>Gothic</h4>
    <p> 
      The Gothic style of architecture and art originated in the Middle Ages and was prevalent in Europe between the mid-12th 
      century and the 16th century. It was heavily ornate and conceptual, with its architecture characterised by high buildings, 
      intricate aesthetics, cavernous spaces and expansive walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gothic style was an evolution from Romanesque, which was marked by its many arches, vaulted ceilings and smaller stained 
      glass windows. The Gothic style took these features and exaggerated them, increasing the scale of arches and the magnitude 
      of the windows. The walls of the buildings, however, became thinner and were supported by flying buttresses to assist the 
      architects in achieving structures that appeared to be closer to the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most fundamental element of the Gothic style of architecture is the pointed arch, which was likely borrowed from
       Islamic architecture that would have been seen in Spain at this time. The pointed arch relieved some of the thrust, 
       and therefore, the stress on other structural elements

    <h4>Baroque</h4>
    <p> 
      Baroque architecture, architectural style originating in late 16th-century Italy and lasting in some regions, notably 
      Germany and colonial South America, until the 18th century. It had its origins in the Counter-Reformation, when the 
      Catholic Church launched an overtly emotional and sensory appeal to the faithful through art and architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complex architectural plan shapes, often based on the oval, and the dynamic opposition and interpenetration of spaces 
      were favoured to heighten the feeling of motion and sensuality. Other characteristic qualities include grandeur, drama 
      and contrast (especially in lighting), curvaceousness, and an often dizzying array of rich surface treatments, twisting
       elements, and gilded statuary.

    <h4>Classical</h4>
    <p> 
      Classical architecture originated in ancient Greece and Rome, and is characterized by symmetry, columns, rectangular windows, 
      and marble, to name a few. For centuries, architects have drawn influence from these civilizations and incorporated traditional
       ideals into subsequent styles of architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classical architecture was constructed in the 5th century BC in Greece and around the 3rd century AD in Rome. The style was revived
      many times over the years. During the Italian Renaissance, architects worked to restore classical Roman architecture. Centuries later
      in Europe, excavations in Pompeii reignited the architecture of ancient Greece. The corresponding architectural style became known as 
      Greek Revival. This architecture focused heavily on the Greek ideal of proportion and structural integrity. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      Classical Revival is a style that came into fashion in the late 19th century and has a looser interpretation of classical ideals. 
      Many homes, courthouses, banks, schools, and churches were built in this style in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

    <h4>Modern</h4>
    <p> 
      Response to large-scale changes in both technology and society. It is associated with the function of buildings, approached from an
      analytical viewpoint, a rational use of materials, the elimination of ornament and decoration, and openness to structural innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modernism developed across all artistic fields, not just architecture, as a means of accommodating and responding to the new technologies of
       machines, automation and urban design. The industrial revolution played a major role in the development of architecture that was driven by 
       functional priority. Materials such as concrete, glass and steel were industrially manufactured in this era.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Architects adopted ideologies bringing out the truth of the structure rather than covering them up with ornamented façades. Modernism 
      encompasses many different variations, including Futurism, Constructivism,

    <h3>Architectural technology  </h3>
    <p>
        Architecture and technology have always intersected at a precarious crossroads. In a very real sense, architecture
        and design are applied sciences that utilize research and development in technology to propel their work to new 
        heights, presenting buildings and products that are not only more interesting, but more responsible and useful as
        well. Everything from digital drawing and rendering, to construction documents and building are becoming easier 
        to do with better results.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Everything we use on a day to day basis is being affected by breakthroughs in technology. Some of these things are vital to our everyday lives,
        others simply make things easier. Imagine a world where you could avoid flossing forever and avoid the passive aggressive shame that comes with 
        a yearly dentist visit. Keep imagining it, because we aren’t quite there yet. We are, however, well on our way to removing the mundanity from 
        life allowing humans to focus their time on the things that matter most. The following products, designs, buildings and ideas are what the people
        around the world are coming up with using technology as their inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that many people having access to emerging technology, we are learning how to better use them on a massive scale. This article hopes to outline
        some of that technology, and show how it is being used by architects, designers and artists to build a better, more efficient, more visually stunning digital world.
